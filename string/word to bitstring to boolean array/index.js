// Create a function that converts a word to a bitstring and then to a boolean array based on the following criteria:

// Locate the position of the letter in the English alphabet (from 1 to 26).
// Odd positions will be represented as 1 and even positions will be represented as 0.
// Convert the represented positions to boolean values, 1 for true and 0 for false.
// Store the conversions into an array.
// Notes
// The letter A is at position 1 and Z at 26.
// All input strings are in lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

// toBoolArray("deep") âžž [false, true, true, false]
// deep converts to 0110
// d is the 4th alphabet - 0
// e is the 5th alphabet - 1
// e is the 5th alphabet - 1
// p is the 16th alphabet - 0
